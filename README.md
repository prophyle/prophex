ProPhex is an efficient k-mer index with a small memory footprint. It uses the
[BWA](http://github.com/lh3/bwa) implementation of the BWT-index. ProPhex is
designed as a core computational component of
[ProPhyle](https://prophyle.github.io), a phylogeny-based metagenomic
classifier allowing fast and accurate read assignment.


## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/prophyle/prophex
cd prophex && make -j
```

### Alternative ways of installation

```
conda install prophex
```



## Quick example


```
# Build a ProPhex index
./prophex index -k 25 index.fa

# Query reads from reads.fq for k=25 (with k-LCP)
./prophex query -k 25 -u -t 4 index.fa index.fq

# Query reads from reads.fq for k=20 (with 4 threads and without k-LCP)
./prophex query -k 20 index.fa index.fq

```

## Output format

Matches are reported in an extended
[Kraken format](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/MANUAL.html#output-format).
ProPhex produces a tab-delimited file with the following columns:

1. Category (unused, `U` as a legacy value)
2. Sequence name
3. Final decision (unused, `0` as a legacy value)
4. Sequence length
5. Assigned k-mers. Space-delimited list of k-mer blocks with the same assignments. The list is of
   the following format: comma-delimited list of sets (or `A` for ambiguous, or
 Â  `0` for no matches), colon, length. Example: `2157,393595:1 393595:1 0:16` (the first k-mer assigned to the nodes `2157` and `393595`, the second k-mer assigned to `393595`, the subsequent 16 k-mers unassigned)
6. Bases (optional)
7. Base qualities (optional)


## FAQs

> Can I remove duplicate k-mers from the index in order to use less memory when querying?

Yes, duplicate k-mers can be removed using
[ProphAsm](https://github.com/prophyle/prophasm), which assembles contigs by
greedy enumeration of disjoint paths in the associated de-Bruijn graph.
[BCalm](https://github.com/GATB/bcalm) is another tool that can be used with
ProPhex. Compared to ProPhex, BCalm has a smaller memory footprint. On the
other hand, the resulting FASTA file can be significantly bigger (when
assemblying, BCalm stops at every branching k-mer).
